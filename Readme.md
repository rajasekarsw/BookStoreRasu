RestAssured Framework for testing Book API (By Shiv Sahil Guleri)

## How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites

- Maven 3.8.4+
- Java 17+
- Git
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
- Run Book Store API on local machine after reading the Book API's own README.md file

### Steps to Execute

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookapi-tests.git
   cd RestAssuredRasu
2. set env as QA in config file using, env=QA
3. Run the Scenarios
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
4.  Reports are generated with a time stamped named for easy identification
    cd BookStoreRasu/extentreports

## ðŸ“Š Test Reports
- [TestNG HTML Report](extentreports/samplereport.html)

## Validation Covered
Validation is handled through the *WrappedAssert* class, which extends TestNGâ€™s built-in assertions with Log4j and ExtentReports integration.

1. Header and body validations are covered within the test cases.
2. Schema validation is built into the testcase
3. Status code validation is also built into the testcases.
4. Negative test cases are included as well.


## Project Structure Implementation Details

- Each API request is mapped to a corresponding **test class** with the same name.  
  Example: *Createbook* request is tested in **`CreateBook.java`**.

- A single test class can contain **multiple test cases**.

- **Records** are used for serialization and deserialization of request and response bodies.

#### Request Chaining
- The token generated from a **login request** is reused across subsequent requests.
- Newly created **username and password** are also reused in other requests.
- **`dependsOnGroups`** and **`dependsOnMethods`** annotations ensure proper test execution order.

#### ApiMethods
- Handles sending HTTP requests: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
- Accepts **path parameters** and **query parameters**.
#### SpecBuilder
- Provides reusable request/response specifications.

#### Data-Driven Testing
- Implemented using **`@DataProvider`** to supply multiple input sets using iterator for test cases.

#### Assertions
- Hamcrest assertions
- Schema validation by Json schema validator 

#### Schema Management
- JSON Schemas for expected responses are stored in a **dedicated folder** for better organization.

## Testing Strategy
- request chaining was done for shairing token, new email, new pwd.

- `**POSTIVE WORKFLOW** health Check up>> creation of new user >> login to get access token >> get all books >> create new Book >> Validating of new book is displayed in the list of all the books >> getting newly created book by ID >> update newly added book >> check this newly added book in list of all the book >> Delete newly added book >> Delete all books`

- `**NEGATIVE TESTCASES** Validating creation of new user with existing email, Login using incorrect _SET OF_ credentails, Validating if books are not displayed when invalid token used, Validating if books are not displayed when NO token used, Validating user unable to search a book with incorrect ID, try to twice delete a book, unable to search deleted book, Incorrectly formatted JSON file validation, validating using expired and incorrect token`
- Records used for searlization and desearlization
- Negative testcases are covered.
- validation of Body, header, status code, schema is also covered.
- @DataProvider is to supply multiple input sets for test cases.
-  yml file for **gitHub action** has already been added

## List of issues
-  I am  unable to create *Invalid JSON Request Body** which could give us 422 status using POJO classs .
   Instead of relying on serialization, I build the string manually.
- When incorrect credentials are provided during login, the server responds with a 400 Bad Request instead of a 401 Unauthorized.
- During the login request validation, I found that the request is processed regardless of the provided user ID.
- If a user tries to retrieve all books with an incorrect token, they receive a 403 Forbidden error instead of a 401 Unauthorized.
- When attempting to add a new book with an existing ID, the server returns a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating it cannot handle duplicate IDs.
- There is currently no functionality to delete users, making test data cleanup impossible.
- since API provided to me was on local machine. I hosted it on my local machine using "ssh -R 80:127.0.0.1:8000 serveo.net". after that I added the temporary URL to my config file.
